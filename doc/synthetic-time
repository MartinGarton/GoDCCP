The key insight in multi-goroutine synthetic time is that between every two
moments of simulated time, exactly all active goroutines must perform exactly
one state-changing (e.g. time query operations don't count) interaction
(functional call) with the runtime.
These interactions would be one of:
	sleep
	return from blocking exchange with external environment
	kill goroutine (can we capture these?)
	spawn go-routine
