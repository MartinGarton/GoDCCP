	INVARIANT: Keep track of the time remaining until the next packet in the pipe should be
	released to the reader side

	Block until either timeout is reached, or a new packet has entered the pipe

	If new packet arrived, place all queued packets in chronological order, ascending in 
	delivery time

	If timeout reached, deliver packet to user read (unblock the read call)

	Repeat forever
