* Idle and application limited periods
   (5.1) The allowed sending rate is never reduced to less than the [RFC3390]
   initial sending rate as the result of an idle period.  If the allowed
   sending rate is less than the initial sending rate upon entry to the
   idle period, then it will still be less than the initial sending rate
   when the idle period is exited.  However, if the allowed sending rate
   is greater than or equal to the initial sending rate upon entry to
   the idle period, then it should not be reduced below the initial
   sending rate no matter how long the idle period lasts.
