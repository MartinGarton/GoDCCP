* (Virtual) Timer interface for DCCP framework
* Rename segment<->header connection
* Eavesdropper pipe. Knobs:
	* virtual time duration
	* inject drops by time or packet number

===========================================================================================

* For testing: mechanism for communicating various events like tmo expiration, etc.
* Add check on AckNo's to make sure they are not smaller than the initial sequence number
* Reduce calls to time.Nanoseconds in dccp
* Fix for circular arithmetic everywhere where SeqNo and AckNo are involved: loss.go, etc.

————— LONG-TERM —————

* Idle and application limited periods
   (5.1) The allowed sending rate is never reduced to less than the [RFC3390]
   initial sending rate as the result of an idle period.  If the allowed
   sending rate is less than the initial sending rate upon entry to the
   idle period, then it will still be less than the initial sending rate
   when the idle period is exited.  However, if the allowed sending rate
   is greater than or equal to the initial sending rate upon entry to
   the idle period, then it should not be reduced below the initial
   sending rate no matter how long the idle period lasts.

* Add backup RTT calculation in receiver based on Timestamps
	* Measure RTT based on CCVal and Timestamp opts and print head-to-head

————— FEATURES NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED —————

* TimestampEcho option and RTT estimates based on it
* Data Dropped Option
* Slow Receiver Option
