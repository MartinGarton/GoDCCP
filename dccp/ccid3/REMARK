loss intervals
==============

A missing data packet doesn't begin a new loss interval until NDUPACK packets have been seen
after the "hole", where NDUPACK = 3


feedback packet
===============
	(-) receiver sends a feedback packet to the sender roughly once per round-trip time, if the sender is
	  sending packets that frequentlyV
	(-) contains:
	   1. An Elapsed Time and/or Timestamp Echo option specifying the amount
	      of time elapsed since the arrival at the receiver of the packet
	      whose sequence number appears in the Acknowledgement Number field.
	      These options are described in [RFC4340], Section 13.

	   2. A Receive Rate option, defined in Section 8.3, specifying the rate
	      at which data was received since the last DCCP-Ack was sent.

	   3. A Loss Intervals option, defined in Section 8.6, specifying the
	      most recent loss intervals experienced by the receiver.  (The
	      definition of a loss interval is provided below.)  From Loss
	      Intervals, the sender can easily calculate the loss event rate p
	      using the procedure described in [RFC3448], Section 5.4.

allowed sending rate 
	(-)  does not reduce below initial sending rate as a result of idle time
	(-) < 2*ReceiveRate reported by receiver
		(-) => after an application- limited period, the sender can at most double its sending rate from one
		    round-trip time to the next, until it reaches the allowed sending rate determined by the loss event
		    rate

sending rate, determined by loss event rate

packet size
	(-) MAY calculate s as the segment size averaged over multiple round trip times -- for example, over the
	    most recent four loss intervals
	(-) OR set to MSS

Maximum Segment Size (MSS) = the maximum size in bytes for the data segment, not including the
default DCCP and IP packet headers
