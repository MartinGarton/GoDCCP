* reset nofeedback timer after processing allowed send rate upon nofeedback expiration, section 4.4.

RTT ESTIMATE*

   When a new RTT estimate is calculated (upon feedback packet arrival),
   update the timeout interval:

     RTO = max(4*R, 2*s/X)

NOFEEDBACK*

   If the sender hasn't received a feedback packet from the receiver when the nofeedback timer
   expires, then the sender halves its allowed sending rate. The allowed sending rate is never reduced
   below one packet per 64 seconds.

   Take care of RTO both in onFirstRead and OnRead

RATE

   ... with the nofeedback timer expiring after two
   seconds. The allowed sending rate is halved each time the nofeedback
   timer expires. 

===========================================================================================

* Add check on AckNo's to make sure they are not smaller than the initial sequence number
* Reduce calls to time.Nanoseconds in dccp
* Fix for circular arithmetic everywhere where SeqNo and AckNo are involved: loss.go, etc.
