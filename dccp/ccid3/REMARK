* (Virtual) Timer interface for DCCP framework
* Rename segment<->header connection
* Eavesdropper pipe. Knobs:
	* virtual time duration
	* inject drops by time or packet number

===========================================================================================

* For testing: mechanism for communicating various events like tmo expiration, etc.
* Add check on AckNo's to make sure they are not smaller than the initial sequence number
* Reduce calls to time.Nanoseconds in dccp
* Fix for circular arithmetic everywhere where SeqNo and AckNo are involved: loss.go, etc.
