Receiver:

* MUST send feedback, if:

	* A newly calculated loss event rate p is greater than its previous value

	* The feedback timer expires and data packets have been received since the previous feedback was sent


	* Whenever the receiver sends a feedback message, the receiver sets a local variable last_counter to
	the greatest received value of the window counter since the last feedback message was sent, if any
	data packets have been received since the last feedback message was sent.
	
	If the receiver receives a data packet with a window counter value greater than or equal to
	last_counter + 4, then the receiver sends a new feedback packet.


	* An Elapsed Time and/or Timestamp Echo option specifying the amount of time elapsed since the arrival
	at the receiver of the packet whose sequence number appears in the Acknowledgement Number field.
	These options are described in [RFC4340], Section 13.

* Loss interval sequence numbers are delta encoded starting from the Acknowledgement Number.
Therefore, Loss Intervals options MUST NOT be sent on packets without an Acknowledgement Number
???

* Measure RTT based on CCVal and Timestamp opts and print head-to-head



[S–nofeedback—timer]
After a feedback packet is received, the sender sets a nofeedback timer to at least four times the
round- trip time estimate
¡
If the sender doesn't receive any feedback packets before the nofeedback timer expires, then the
sender halves its sending rate.





allowed sending rate 
	(-)  does not reduce below initial sending rate as a result of idle time
	(-) < 2*ReceiveRate reported by receiver
		(-) => after an application- limited period, the sender can at most double its sending rate from one
		    round-trip time to the next, until it reaches the allowed sending rate determined by the loss event
		    rate

sending rate, determined by loss event rate

packet size
	(-) MAY calculate s as the segment size averaged over multiple round trip times -- for example, over the
	    most recent four loss intervals
	(-) OR set to MSS

(DataDropped & SlowReceiver)

---

Maximum Segment Size (MSS) = the maximum size in bytes for the data segment, not including the
default DCCP and IP packet headers


===========================================================================================
Ask Eddie 
	* How can SkipLength be limited to 3, when there are othe condition that can make it longer?
	* Why wouldn't the receiver just send the loss rate instead of the interval history?

Add backup RTT calculation in receiver based on Timestamps

A lot of calls to time.Nanoseconds() could be sped up by passing around the current time as an
argument

Fix for circular arithmetic everywhere where SeqNo and AckNo are involved: loss.go, etc.
