[S–nofeedback—timer]
After a feedback packet is received, the sender sets a nofeedback timer to at least four times the
round- trip time estimate
¡
If the sender doesn't receive any feedback packets before the nofeedback timer expires, then the
sender halves its sending rate.





allowed sending rate 
	(-)  does not reduce below initial sending rate as a result of idle time
	(-) < 2*ReceiveRate reported by receiver
		(-) => after an application- limited period, the sender can at most double its sending rate from one
		    round-trip time to the next, until it reaches the allowed sending rate determined by the loss event
		    rate

sending rate, determined by loss event rate

packet size
	(-) MAY calculate s as the segment size averaged over multiple round trip times -- for example, over the
	    most recent four loss intervals
	(-) OR set to MSS

(DataDropped & SlowReceiver)

---

Maximum Segment Size (MSS) = the maximum size in bytes for the data segment, not including the
default DCCP and IP packet headers


===========================================================================================

* Ask Eddie 
	* How can SkipLength be limited to 3, when there are othe condition that can make it longer?
	* Why wouldn't the receiver just send the loss rate instead of the interval history?

* Measure RTT based on CCVal and Timestamp opts and print head-to-head

* Add backup RTT calculation in receiver based on Timestamps

* A lot of calls to time.Nanoseconds() could be sped up by passing around the current time as an
argument

* Fix for circular arithmetic everywhere where SeqNo and AckNo are involved: loss.go, etc.
