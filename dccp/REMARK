* What: Send NDP Count feature is always ON
* Set server state of socket

* Log all packet drops. Will be useful for debugging, since in lab conditions there should be few drops

* THINK: DCCP uses source/dest port to identify flow. We use mux-layer. Reconcile?
* THINK: Is the handshake common to both half-connections or not?

* Header.Write() also writes data

* Add new interface for flow{} so that Read does not take a []byte
	* This same interface should be used for the service that the DCCP-layer
	provides: It's a flow-based unreliable transport that sends and 
	receives packets, not continuous data

* Init Cookies (See '8.1.4. Init Cookie Option') are not supported neither on the
client nor the server side, currently.

// TODO: In theory, long lived connections may wrap around the AckNo/SeqNo space
// in which case maxu64() should not be used below. This will never happen however
// if we are using 48-bit numbers exclusively
