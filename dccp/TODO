PRE-RELEASE

	Implement Conn.SetReadExpire

	Address Ack-Sync pair in client connection establishement, marked XXX in code

	Add heartbeat optional function (in ccid? once every so many RTTs?)

	Handshake with 0-latency, no drops should be fast

POST-RELEASE

	Deal with circular arithmetic of sequence numbers
		In theory, long lived connections may wrap around the AckNo/SeqNo space in which case circular
		versions of things like maxu64() should be used.  This is unlikely to happen however if we are using
		48-bit numbers exclusively

	Update the DCCP Mutex implementation

LONG-TERM

	Dynamically changing SWAF/SWBF

	Abridged header read/write (no ports, no checksums). Not needed in user-space mode

	Make ccvals int8

	Denial of service considerations (Not needed in the context of the Tonika security stack)
		Section 7.5.4: To protect against denial-of-service attacks, DCCP implementations SHOULD impose a
		rate limit on DCCP-Syncs sent in response to sequence-invalid packets, such as not more than eight
		DCCP-Syncs per second.
