-- TEST BEHAVIOR

* why does packet exchange stop in 6 seconds

* ensure behavior stabilizes if both sides remain silent after connect and connection does not close
perpetually
	* write test for this
	* ponder event emit protocol for test writing

-- TEST INFRASTRCTURE

* accelerated synthetic timer instance for the sandbox

* make clog object unique. keep track of last logf and emit time in terms of difference and in terms
of duration since start of 0

* Make sandbox's absolute time relative to the start, so experiments are reproducible
