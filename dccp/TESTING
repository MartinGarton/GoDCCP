-- TEST BEHAVIOR

* Why doesn't CCID kick in? Why does sender receive bad LossIntervals option?
	* SyncAck and Ack packets don't count against loss intervals and receive rate?

-- TEST INFRASTRCTURE

* specify sandbox line rate by (interval, packets per interval) so it allows small bursts

* Make sandbox's absolute time relative to the start, so experiments are reproducible
