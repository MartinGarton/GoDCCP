* sandbox/TestRTT ends up wtih 100s goroutines from calls to "runtime.After"
* since data can be sent in PARTOPEN, the CCID must be open by then

* some emits show up as coming from routine.go
* add round-trip measurements and tests
* add SyncAll.Start() to prevent completion before call to Wait()

* how come the sandbox line allows a packet with higher seq no arrive before one with lower?
* investigate BadHeader logs (and explain in NOTES if not a bug)
* ensure convergence test converges to rate limit of sandbox line

* add side-by-side test

* heartbeat in CCID3

* implement SetReadTimeout

* ensure behavior stabilizes if both sides remain silent after connect and connection does not close
perpetually
	* write test for this

====================================================================================================

* 0 rate calculated in server in TestRTT (disappeared)
* mem & cpu maxout bug in tests (disappeared)
