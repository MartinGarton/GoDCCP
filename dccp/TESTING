* add round-trip measurements and tests
	* rrtt: ccval's written don't seem very sequential

* should loss.go's reorder buffer enforce ascending seq no output?

* why are there random binary symbols in the log output?
* benchmark: packet-type distribution wheighted by packet sizes

* how come the sandbox line allows a packet with higher seq no to arrive before one with lower?
* investigate BadHeader logs (and explain in NOTES if not a bug)
* ensure convergence test converges to rate limit of sandbox line

* add side-by-side test

* heartbeat in CCID3

* implement SetReadTimeout

* ensure behavior stabilizes if both sides remain silent after connect and connection does not close
perpetually
	* write test for this

====================================================================================================

* some emits show up as coming from routine.go (cannot be done)
* sandbox/TestRTT ends up wtih 100s goroutines from calls to "runtime.After" (probably be OK when
  rate calculated correctly. get back to it.)
* 0 rate calculated in server in TestRTT (disappeared)
* mem & cpu maxout bug in tests (disappeared)
