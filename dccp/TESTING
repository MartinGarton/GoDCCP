-- TEST BEHAVIOR

* why does packet exchange stop in 6 seconds

* make clog object unique. keep track of last logf and emit time in terms of difference and in terms
of duration since start of 0

* timer/sleeper interface for DCCP
	* accelerated synthetic timer instance for the sandbox

* ensure behavior stabilizes if both sides remain silent after connect and connection does not close
perpetually
	* write test for this
	* ponder event emit protocol for test writing

-- TEST INFRASTRCTURE

* specify sandbox line rate by (interval, packets per interval) so it allows small bursts

* Make sandbox's absolute time relative to the start, so experiments are reproducible
