-- TEST BEHAVIOR

* Why doesn't CCID kick in? Why does sender receive bad LossIntervals option?
	* SyncAck and Ack packets don't count against loss intervals and receive rate?

* Verify that I see two closely-spaced strobes for the two closely-spaced packets that
come out of client and get rejected by the sandbox line.

-- TEST INFRASTRCTURE

* Make sandbox's absolute time relative to the start, so experiments are reproducible
