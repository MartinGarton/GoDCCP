* log framework per-instance, so concurrent tests don't pollute each other's logs
* why does openclose test go forever? hang on ReadSegment?

* method for immediate termination of DCCP (loop, TIMEWAIT and all)
* why does idleness for 1 minute produce no heartbeats?

* implement SetReadTimeout

* ensure behavior stabilizes if both sides remain silent after connect and connection does not close
perpetually
	* write test for this
