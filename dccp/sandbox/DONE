Can endpoints estimate RTT?
* Yes. Test included.

	clientÂ·sender never gets an Ack or DataAck (during idle periods), which
	carries Elapsed option, which is needed for RTT estimate
		* See [OptAck] below.

	[OptAck] Should Elapsed options be limited to Ack and DataAck, as opposed to also
	other packets that contain acknowledgements? Are there other such packet types?
		* Only Ack and DataAck have acks which is needed for Elapsed and, yes,
		Elapsed is limitted to those only by design, since the lack of those implies
		slow app send speed an no need for good estimates of RTT.

	Need mechanism to ensure Ack sent back to client in presence of Idle?
		* No. It's OK if client stays in PARTOPEN. Just means it must
		send Acks with any data it sends. RFC Section 8.1.5 for details.

	Ensure that user-side of DCCP client is available for i/o when in
	PARTOPEN, but until in PARTOPEN all data is sent in DataAcks.

Client sends 10 packets in the first second, only 3 of which are received?  
No drops are reported. Is there a programmatic delay?
	* Sender's rate control switches to 1pps at the start

Why don't we drop data packets if the data queue is full?
	* Because making the user Write wait is the only way to communicate to the user
	at what rate to send data.
