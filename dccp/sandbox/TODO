Loss tests

Rate tests
	ensure one-way convergence test converges to rate limit of sandbox line
		vary data size
		vary roundtrip time
		measure response to changes to either
	ensure two competing connections behave fairly

Make an experiment class to unify boilerplate in tests

Should loss.go's reorder buffer enforce ascending seq no output?

RTT test, without constant rate constraint, causes division by zero error in rate calculation (in SetRate)

Ensure behavior stabilizes if both sides remain silent after connect and connection does not close perpetually

Infrastructre for tests of the form:
	"first packet after switched to OPEN state does not produce 'missing rtt report' log"
