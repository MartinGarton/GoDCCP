* add RTT estimation test
	* strobe wait time is currently captured in RTT emit measure
		* this same issue probably applies to RTT measurements themselves
	* sandbox reducer should feed its measruements of rtt/2 back into emit stream
	* profile w/ pprof
	* memory profile
	* why are the RTT curves different every time and with values quite high
	* add latency simulation in pipe
	* why are there unclaimed packets in roundtrip reducer measurements

* rtt test, without constant rate constraint, causes division by zero error in rate calculation (in SetRate)

* infrastructre for tests of the form:
	"first packet after switched to OPEN state does not produce 'missing rtt report' log"

GOALS

* Handshake with 0-latency, no drops should be fast
