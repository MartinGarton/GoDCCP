* add RTT estimation test

* rtt test, without constant rate constraint, causes division by zero error in rate calculation (in SetRate)

* infrastructre for tests of the form:
	"first packet after switched to OPEN state does not produce 'missing rtt report' log"

GOALS

* Handshake with 0-latency, no drops should be fast
