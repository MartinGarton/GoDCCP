dccp_test.go:TestIdle

1.	Can endpoints estimate RTT?

	1.1.	Client never gets an Ack or DataAck,
			which carries Elapsed option,
			which is needed for RTT estimate

		1.1.1.	Should Elapsed options be limited to Ack and DataAck?

		1.1.2.	Need mechanism to ensure Ack sent to client in presence of Idle!

	1.2.	(OK) Client sends 10 packets in the first second, only 3 of which are received?
		No drops are reported. Is there a programmatic delay?
		(A) Sender's rate control switches to 1pps at the start
