dccp_test.go:TestIdle

1.	Can endpoints estimate RTT?

	1.1.	ClientÂ·Sender never gets an Ack or DataAck,
			which carries Elapsed option,
			which is needed for RTT estimate

		1.1.1.	Should Elapsed options be limited to Ack and DataAck, as opposed to also
			other packets that contain acknowledgements? Are there other such packet types?

		1.1.2.	(OK) Need mechanism to ensure Ack sent back to client in presence of Idle?
			* No. It's OK if client stays in PARTOPEN. Just means it must
			send Acks with any data it sends. Section 8.1.5 for details.

			1.1.2.1. (OK) Ensure that user-side of DCCP client is available for i/o when in
			PARTOPEN, but until in PARTOPEN all data is sent in DataAcks.

		1.1.3.  Add an on/off heartbeat mechanism that ensures one interaction each RTT interval.

	1.2.	(OK) Client sends 10 packets in the first second, only 3 of which are received?
		No drops are reported. Is there a programmatic delay?
		* Sender's rate control switches to 1pps at the start
