TODO TESTING

* after 1sec, CCID has not been open on server

TODO PRE-RELEASE

* address Ack-Sync pair in client connection establishement, marked XXX in code

* dynamically changing SWAF/SWBF

* implement Conn.SetReadTimeout

TODO LONG-TERM

* abridged header read/write (no ports, no checksums)

* deal with circular arithmetic of sequence numbers

In theory, long lived connections may wrap around the AckNo/SeqNo space in which case circular
versions of things like maxu64() should be used.  This is unlikely to happen however if we are using
48-bit numbers exclusively

* denial of service considerations

Section 7.5.4: To protect against denial-of-service attacks, DCCP implementations SHOULD impose a
rate limit on DCCP-Syncs sent in response to sequence-invalid packets, such as not more than eight
DCCP-Syncs per second.
