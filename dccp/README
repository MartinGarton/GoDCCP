* address Ack-Sync pair in client connection establishement, marked XXX in code

* replace all time.Nanoseconds() with func args?
* dynamically changing SWAF/SWBF
* Conn.SetReadTimeout
* abridged header read/write (no ports, no checksums)

// TODO: In theory, long lived connections may wrap around the AckNo/SeqNo space
// in which case maxu64() should not be used below. This will never happen however
// if we are using 48-bit numbers exclusively

// TODO: Section 7.5.4
// To protect against denial-of-service attacks, DCCP implementations
// SHOULD impose a rate limit on DCCP-Syncs sent in response to
// sequence-invalid packets, such as not more than eight DCCP-Syncs per
// second.
