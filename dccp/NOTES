IMPLEMENTATION and PROTOCOL NOTES
=================================

* We don't start CCID in PARTOPEN (rather wait until OPEN), because
in PARTOPEN the client still needs to send (Ack,Sync) packet pairs,
but the initial CCID rate is 1 packet per second, which slows down
the handshake to OPEN, since the second packet of the (Ack,Sync)
sequence has to wait for a whole second.

* Upon entrance to CLOSING state the CCID is closed. However, the CLOSING logic
in DCCP ensures that Close packets are sent at a conservative rate.
