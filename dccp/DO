TODO PRE-RELEASE ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

* convert backoff/expire mechanisms to work in a polling model, so that all concurrent 
backoffs/expires can be handled by a single thread

* implement Conn.SetReadExpire

* address Ack-Sync pair in client connection establishement, marked XXX in code

* deal with circular arithmetic of sequence numbers
	In theory, long lived connections may wrap around the AckNo/SeqNo space in which case circular
	versions of things like maxu64() should be used.  This is unlikely to happen however if we are using
	48-bit numbers exclusively

* update the DCCP Mutex implementation

* backward time bug dccp/gauge/reduce.go:74

TODO LONG-TERM ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

* dynamically changing SWAF/SWBF

* abridged header read/write (no ports, no checksums)

* make ccvals int8

* denial of service considerations
	Section 7.5.4: To protect against denial-of-service attacks, DCCP implementations SHOULD impose a
	rate limit on DCCP-Syncs sent in response to sequence-invalid packets, such as not more than eight
	DCCP-Syncs per second.
